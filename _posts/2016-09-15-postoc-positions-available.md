Postdoctoral positions are available in the group of Prof. Alexey Nesvizhskii at
the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (www.nesvilab.org). We have broad
interests in the areas of computational proteomics, transcriptomics, and systems
biology. We are particularly interested in novel computational methods for mass
spectrometry data (including multiplex mass spectrometry using SWATH/DIA
technology), proteogenomics, multi-omics data integration (proteomics, RNA-Seq,
etc.), and large-scale proteomic data mining.

Representative recent publications from the lab:

- C.C. Tsou et al. DIA-Umpire: comprehensive computational framework for data
  independent acquisition proteomics, Nature Methods 12:258-64 (2015).
- A.I. Nesvizhskii, Proteogenomics: concepts, applications, and computational
  strategies, Nature Methods, 11:1114-25 (2014).
- D. Mellacheruvu et al. The CRAPome: a Contaminant Repository for Affinity
  Purification Mass Spectrometry Data. Nature Methods 10 730-736 (2013).
- O. A. Balbin et al. Reconstructing targetable pathways in lung cancer by
  integrating diverse omics data, Nature Communications 4:2617 (2013).
- D. Fermin et al. LuciPHOr: algorithm for phosphorylation site localization
  with false localization rate estimation using target-decoy approach, Mol Cell
  Proteomics 11 3409-19 (2013).

The ideal candidates would have a Ph. D. in bioinformatics or related field,
strong publication record, and excellent computational skills (Java, Python, R,
relational databases, Linux environment are used most commonly in the lab).
Prior experience with mass spectrometry data is a big plus.

The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor is internationally renowned for its
excellent academics, and has been ranked consistently among top research
Universities the United States. Ann Arbor is consistently ranked high on various
"best places to live" lists due to its culturally diversity, large international
community, excellent schools, and convenient living
(http://www.visitannarbor.org/). A major international airport is just 30
minutes away from campus.

Applicants should e-mail their CV to Prof. Alexey Nesvizhskii at
