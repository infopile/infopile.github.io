MSFragger is an ultrafast database search tool that uses a fragment ion indexing
method to rapidly perform spectra similarity comparisons. On a typical quad-core
workstation, MSFragger is able to perform open searching (500 Da precursor mass
window tolerance) in under 10 minutes for a single LC-MS/MS run. It is
implemented in the Java programming language and is available as a standalone
JAR.
